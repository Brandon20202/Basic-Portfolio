            <p>I am 28 years old and I currently live in Austin. I am originally from Fort worth. I enjoy long walks on the beach while I jam me some Kid cudi. I love music, it is my second passion behind computers. I can trouble shoot a PC and Mac. I have a 9 year old daughter. She is my world and joy. She loves everything that is bright and cute. I wish she enjoyed sports as much as I do but its still time to get her into them. </p>
